# Turborepo starter

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `client`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `server`: [Nest.js](https://docs.nestjs.com/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `client` and `server` applications
- `monaco editor`: a [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) text editor
- `cors`: a [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) node.js package that can be used to enable CORS

- `nodemon`: [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to automatically restart the node application on file changes

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
